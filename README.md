# On-the-Riemann-Hypothesis
We show that the Riemann hypothesis is true in this paper by using the properties of the Mellin transform of the zeta function in the critical strip at zeta(s)=0. We also create a function I(a) and prove that it's injective by using antisymmetry and Fourier transformation.
